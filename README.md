<h1>Flask Notes</h1>
<p>This web application is an example of how to create a web application that stores users in database and lets them store notes. An introductory project for implementing Python, Flask, and Postgresql</p>
<p>This project can also be an example of how to create a working login/signup page that uses sessions in order to protect the user's information</p>
<br>
<em>To start the project have a database assigned (can use the example psql file to create the table) and do the following in terminal. As in most flask projects, start with exporting variables:</em>
<ol>
    <li>$ export DATABASE_URL = <em>your database/online database</em></li>
    <li>$ export FLASK_ENV=development,</li>
    <li>$ export FLASK_APP=application.py</li>
    <li>$ flask run</li>
</ol>
